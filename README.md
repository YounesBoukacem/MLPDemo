# Presentation
- MLPDemo is a repository containing various experiments showcasing how to use neural networks for various tasks (whether serious tasks 🤓 or just toy examples 😎).
- While the CNN course is in pdf format, the Feed Forward and RNN courses are organized as a series of exclidraw slides which you can find in the excalidraw/ folder 📁 of each course. You can easily open them by installing the excalidraw extension of vscode which will allow you to both view the slides and modify them if you wish ! ( We will produce PDF files for easier access ASAP ).
- These courses were prepared by students 👨‍🎓 for students 🧑‍🎓. We tried to make sure to the best of our abilities that the contents are relevant and accurate. Please feel free to kindly suggest any corrections if you notice any problem 😄.
