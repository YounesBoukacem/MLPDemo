# Presentation
- MLPDemo is a repository containing various experiments showcasing how to use neural networks for various tasks (whether serious tasks 🤓 or just toy examples 😎).
- While the CNN course is in pdf format, the Feed Forward and RNN courses are organized as a series of exclidraw slides which you can find in the excalidraw/ folder of each course. You can easily open them by installing the excalidraw extension of vscode which will allow you to both view the slides and modify them if you wish ! ( We will produce PDF files for easier access ASAP )
